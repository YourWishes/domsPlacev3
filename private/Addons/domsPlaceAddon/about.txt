<p>
	Hello, and welcome to domsPlace, my place on the internet.
</p>

<p>
	As suggested above, my name is Dominic Masters, I am a 21-year-old programmer from Australia.<br />
</p>

<p>
	I have been programming as long as I can remember, dating back to before high school, and enjoy it immensely.
	Long stories aside I have dedicated this website as a portfolio of me, my projects, my interests and my personal blog.
</p>

<p>
	Since 2011 I have been developing websites professionally, and first developed this website back in early 2013.
	Since then I have completely rewritten the site twice, however, short of any major breakthroughs in web technologies I
	have settled on this as the final platform for the site. <br />
